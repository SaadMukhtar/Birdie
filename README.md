# Birdie
Birdie is a 2D runner game where you play as a bird and avoid pipes to gain points and survive. This game was inspired by the famous mobile game called Flappy Bird. 

This is a game I created in Grade 11 using Java Applet for my Computer Science class. Unfortunately, Applet is no longer supported in Java.
