# Birdie
Birdie is a 2D runner game where you play as a bird and avoid pipes to gain points to survive. This game was inspired by the famous mobile game called Flappy Bird. 

This is a game I created in Grade 11 with a friend using Java Applet for my Computer Science class. 

## Instructions
Unfortunately, Applet is not supported in most of the popular IDE's anymore.
My recommendation would be to run the java file on an IDE called DrJava.
